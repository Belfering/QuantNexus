# Phase 1: Split Options

For time periods "IS/OOS Split" should always be checked, we will not allow anything else. There needs to be 2 options. "Split" with the following options "Defined" (which is currently named "Chronological" so keep that the same, but rename it to Defined), "50/50", "60/40", and "70/30". For the 50/50 option it will automatically figure out the max backtest length and take the first 50% of trading days as the IS and the second 50% as OOS. This will then carry across to the 60/40, and 70/30 the same way 60 IS/ 40 OOS, 70 IS / 30 OOS.

The second option will be "Rolling" and it will have the sub option of "Yearly", "Monthly", and "Daily". For now we can just leave this as "coming soon" if selected.
