## Summary
Introduce basic product/company branding across the app and docs. Initial company name idea: `Atlas Nexus`.

## Goals
- Establish a consistent name/brand in the UI (header, title, favicon) and key docs.
- Keep branding lightweight and easy to iterate (no heavy marketing site work yet).

## Non-goals
- Final logo design system, full style guide, or marketing website.
- Legal trademark work.

## UX / UI
- Header brand: display `Atlas Nexus` (or `Atlas Nexus — System.app`) in the top-left area.
- Browser tab title and favicon reflect the brand.
- Maintain existing navigation layout; this is primarily copy + small visual polish.

## Acceptance Criteria
- App shows `Atlas Nexus` branding in the header and document title.
- Favicon and metadata can be updated in one place.

## Open Questions
- Should the visible product name be `Atlas Nexus` or `System.app` with `Atlas Nexus` as the company name?
- Do we want a short tagline under/next to the brand?
