# Phase 3: Custom Ticker Lists

Custom ticker lists for the branch section. Downloadable metadata, uploadable ticker lists. Saved ticker lists. Linking those ticker lists as variables to the ticker setionsi n parameters. A "cycle through" or "Match ticker exactly" option. Which would mean that if the 10d RSI of [SPY (chosen from ticker list #1)] is Less Than 30 and ticker list #1 has 200 tickers on it then the "then buy position node with [ticker list #1] in it would only test SPY/SPY conditions ,no the buy 199 other assets there and test those. Ill define this more later.
